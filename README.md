CS152 LBA
===========
This is my location-based assignment for CS152 (Fall 2017) at the Minerva Schools at KGI.
The requirements entailed creating an expert system in Prolog for recommending restaurants, cafes, or diners to future Minerva students based on the price range of food, availability of an English menu, distance from accommodation, accessibility by public transport, type of cuisine, type of meals (e.g. just cafe food or more substantial), availability of vegetarian options, and availability of gluten-free options.

The React-based GUI was created as an extension to this assignment and bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). View it at [https://jdecked.github.io/CS152-LBA](https://jdecked.github.io/CS152-LBA).
